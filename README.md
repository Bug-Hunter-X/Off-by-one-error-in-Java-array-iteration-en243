# Off-by-One Error in Java Array Iteration

This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The error occurs because the loop condition incorrectly allows the loop to access an index that is outside the bounds of the array, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.

The `bug.java` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.java` provides the corrected version.  The issue is explained in detail in the comments within the code.
